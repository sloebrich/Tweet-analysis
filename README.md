# NLP with Disaster Tweets
A notebook for the Kaggle competition "Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets" (https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview).

After some data preprocessing and visualization, we encode the tweet data into document vectors and run a grid search to find the stochastic gradient descent classifier with the optimal F1-score.
